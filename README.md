# DeerRunner ðŸ¦Œ

> **NOTE** This is a very *early and hacky* utility made for my personal use, as it stands it is not really usable by a general audience. This will hopefully change as I continue to develop and use it.

**DeerRunner** is a linux utility for automatically porting and natively running games made in certain supported engines. The goal is:

* Being able to easily run games through a simple `RunGame' command inside the game's directory
* Allow more games to be playable on arm linux
* Avoid some of the perfomance and compatibility issues that come with using Wine.

## Supported Engines

* **renpy** - python based visual novel engine
* **mkxp-z** - rpg maker xp
* **nw.js** - various engines (ie. rpg maker mv/mz)
